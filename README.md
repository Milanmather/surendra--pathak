Hi! I’m Surendra — a data-driven problem solver with a background in **IT engineering** and hands-on experience building machine-learning projects including **taxi demand forecasting, churn prediction, and used-car price modeling**.  
I enjoy working with **Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, SQL, Matplotlib, and CatBoost** to turn raw data into insights and real business impact.

I completed the **TripleTen Data Science program**, where I developed skills in feature engineering, model evaluation, statistical testing, and ML optimization using tools like LightGBM, RandomForest, and ARIMA. I’m especially interested in applying data science to **operations, finance, and product optimization** — inspired by real-world experience working in hospitality and restaurant operations at **Chipotle**.
